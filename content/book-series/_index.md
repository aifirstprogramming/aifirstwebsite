## AI First Book Series

The **AI First Programming** book series from **Apress** introduces a revolutionary approach to learning computer science. Instead of teaching programming in isolation, these books integrate AI coding assistants from the very first lesson, preparing you for the modern development environment.

### Available Titles

#### AI First Python Programming

Master Python programming using the latest AI tools and techniques. This book guides you through Python fundamentals while teaching you to work effectively with AI coding assistants.

#### AI First Java Programming

Learn Java programming the modern way. From your first "Hello World" program to advanced concepts, you'll build Java applications with AI assistance while developing deep understanding of the language.

### What Makes These Books Different?

**Traditional Approach:**
- Learn syntax first, discover AI tools later
- Write code manually from scratch
- Limited exposure to modern development workflows

**AI First Approach:**
- Learn programming and AI tools together
